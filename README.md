# Done For You Insurance Agency — Website (v2, scroll-video hero)

Second version of the marketing site. Same long landing page as v1, with two
changes: the hero is a **scroll-scrubbed video** instead of an animated canvas,
and the palette matches the real brand identity (navy / gold / orange) taken
from the logo in the hero footage.

**v1 is still live and untouched** at
https://brynt-crypto.github.io/dfy-insurance-site/ — compare the two before
picking one.

## The scroll-video hero

`components/HeroScrub.tsx`. The hero section is two viewport-heights tall and
its inner frame is sticky, so the video holds on screen while the page scrolls
past. Scroll position maps onto the video's `currentTime`, so the footage runs
forward as you scroll down and backward as you scroll up. The video is never
*played* — only seeked — which is why it works on iOS, where autoplay is
restricted.

The source clip (`assets/HERO COVER.mov`) was processed before use:

- trimmed to 7.4s, dropping a static end card that occupied the last half
- cropped to remove a generative-AI watermark in the top-left corner
- audio stripped (browsers block autoplay with sound)
- re-encoded H.264 with a keyframe every 5 frames, so seeking is smooth
  rather than jumping between distant keyframes

Note the footage is AI-generated and the people in it are not real clients or
staff.

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000. (If another project is already using port 3000,
Next will pick 3001 and print the URL it chose.)

```bash
npm run build   # production build — this is what Vercel runs
npm run lint
```

## Where to change things

**All copy and brand data lives in [`lib/site.ts`](lib/site.ts).** The company
name, phone number, address, license number, coverage descriptions, FAQ answers,
and stats are all there. No component has hard-coded text, so renaming the
agency or swapping the phone number is one edit in one file.

Items still using stand-in values are marked with `TODO:` comments:

- Phone number and office address
- License number
- Carrier names in the trust bar
- The 4.8★ review count

**Design tokens live in [`app/globals.css`](app/globals.css)** — colors,
type scale, spacing, radii, shadows. Change a token there and it applies
everywhere. The palette is navy + confident blue, with gold reserved for
rating stars only.

## Structure

```
app/
  layout.tsx      fonts, metadata, nav + footer shell, skip link
  page.tsx        composes the sections in order
  globals.css     design tokens and component classes
components/
  Hero.tsx        headline block over the animated visual
  HeroCanvas.tsx  the animated node network (Canvas 2D, no three.js)
  Nav.tsx  Footer.tsx  ScrollRail.tsx  Logo.tsx
  Reveal.tsx      the single scroll-entrance animation used site-wide
  Counter.tsx     count-up statistic
  CoverageIcon.tsx  hand-drawn line icons
  sections/       TrustBar, Coverages, Industries, WhyUs, Process,
                  QuoteForm, Faq, CtaBand
lib/site.ts       all copy and brand data
```

## Notes for the next pass

- **The quote form is front-end only.** It validates, shows inline errors, and
  displays a success panel, but nothing is sent anywhere yet. Wiring it to a CRM
  or an email endpoint is the next step — see the `TODO` in
  [`components/sections/QuoteForm.tsx`](components/sections/QuoteForm.tsx).
- **Imagery is intentionally absent.** The layout uses the animated hero, icons,
  and type instead of stock photography. Real photos of the team and office
  would strengthen the Why Us and hero sections.
- **The logo is a placeholder** — a shield mark plus the agency name set in
  Sora. Drop the real logo into `components/Logo.tsx` when it exists.

## Accessibility and motion

- Body text is 17px minimum, nothing on the page is below 15px
- Tap targets are at least 44px; buttons are 52px
- Every interactive element has a visible focus ring, including in Windows
  high-contrast mode
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected everywhere: the hero canvas renders one
  static frame, scroll reveals become instant, and the counters jump to their
  final values
- The hero animation pauses when scrolled out of view and caps device pixel
  ratio at 2, so it stays cheap on laptops and phones
